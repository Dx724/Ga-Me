Eight hours of sleep, eight hours of school, and eight hours of free time. That's how the saying goes. In the fast-paced world we live in today, sometimes this split isn't so clear.

Ga-Me is a simple pong game split across three portable devices which seeks to explore the struggle between these disparate goals and lives of a human. Especially during a busy time like finals season, students may feel that they struggle to keep the split between these parts of their schedule. They must fight for leisure and sleep.

On the surface, the main attraction of Ga-Me is that traditional pong game. This is "work", which may be fun, but players have no choice but to keep hitting that ball. However, when the ball isn't on a player's screen, a generative artistic tool appears. Via a hidden touch-sensitive interface, users can interact with this system to produce stunning and unique masterpieces which take inspiration from the human fingerprint. This represents a person's free time. While on this screen, players can still use the buttons to control the Pong game, which is always visible on one of the three screens at any given moment. And thus emerges the juggling act of balancing these worlds.

The left and right players each control three paddles -- one on each screen. The middle player can influence the movement of the ball, allowing them to aid or sabotage the other two players for his/her own benefit. But here's the catch: if the ball enters into your screen, your artwork is deleted. You'll have to start over next time. Thus, players must carefully balance both sets of controls to fend off the ball as they produce their works of art.
