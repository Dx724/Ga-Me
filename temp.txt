lag in ESP-NOW communication (as we have to slow things down due to heat)
	--> thus have to transfer control of ball to next ESP rather than having central state

get very hot --> slow down caculations

difficulty of testing new code across all three devices
	--> temporary code changes to allow components to be tested on single devices

broken physical button

only putting bugfixes on certain devices

capacitance of air --> random patterns!

beauty in the passive world (while at first sight it seems like Pong is the game, there's another interactive exhibit)

reuse TFT for connection indication as with previous projects (since the first one!)

preprocessor macros leading to recompilation

symmetry in idle despite asymmetry in active state

enclosures without making touch functionality obvious

no frame buffer --> reduce flickering with partial draws

randomized conditions --> have to test dozens of cases

longer games allow for longer drawings --> work hard to enjoy the free time
